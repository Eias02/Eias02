# Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alaa 👋

**AI Engineer** | Future **AI Consultant** | Founder @ *Klysus* (Not yet but am working on :>)

I'm an AI engineer focused on real-world GenAI applications — especially agentic systems. Currently building deep expertise in LLMs, prompt engineering, and full-stack AI workflows. Long-term vision: launch **Klysus**, my own AI solutions company.

<h3>🧠 Current Focus</h3>

- Designing **agentic AI systems** and autonomous workflows
- Developing LLM-based tools using **Python** and modern frameworks
- Engineering solid prompt strategies for production GenAI
- Studying how **hardware principles** and **low-level systems** affect AI performance
- Exploring software architecture, **cybersecurity fundamentals (AISS)**, and systems thinking

<hr/>

<h3>🧰 Toolbox</h3>

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain
- **Data**: MongoDB, Pandas, JSON, SQL(honstly what ever DBMS i need to build it , ill study to master it :?)
- **Infra/Dev**: GitHub Actions, CLI tools, APIs, FastAPI
- **Security**: Basic knowledge of cyber principles (AISS level), system hygiene

<hr/>

<h3>🚀 Goals</h3>

- 🧩 Build and launch **Klysus** — an AI solutions company focused on practical, secure, and scalable GenAI tools
- 🔧 Grow into **AI consulting** as a service layer within Klysus — helping teams integrate agentic AI with real business value
- 📚 Keep combining deep knowledge in **software, hardware, and cybersecurity** to design smarter, more autonomous systems
