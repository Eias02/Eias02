# Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm 3laa 👋

**AI Engineer** | Future **AI Consultant** | Founder @ *Klysus* (Not yet but am working on it :>)

I'm an AI engineer focused on real-world GenAI applications — especially agentic systems. Currently building deep expertise in LLMs, prompt engineering, and full-stack AI workflows. Long-term vision: launch **Klysus**, my own AI solutions company.

## 🧰 Toolbox

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash  
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain  
- **Data**: MongoDB, Pandas, JSON, SQL (Honestly, whatever DBMS I need — I’ll learn it and master it 😎)  
- **Infra/Dev**: GitHub Actions, CLI tools, APIs, FastAPI  
- **Security**: AISS-level cybersecurity knowledge, systems hygiene, basic exploit theory  

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 🧩 Build and launch **Klysus** — an AI solutions company focused on practical, secure, and scalable GenAI tools  
- 🔧 Grow into **AI consulting** as a service layer within Klysus — helping teams integrate agentic AI with real business value  
- 📚 Keep combining deep knowledge in **software, hardware, and cybersecurity** to design smarter, more autonomous systems
